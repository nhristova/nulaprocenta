- Create hat shape layers:
    - inside
    - stripes
    - shape
    - face

- Create painting functionality
    - hat loads with a certain design 
    - the user can modify the colors - when hovering over a stripe - a popup colour dial appears (centred on the cursor) - clicking a colour changes the hovered stripe color
    - add remove elements - pompom, ear flaps

- When edit completed - a hat object is created/sent to cart and a screen-shot of the hat - price is calculated based on the hat object properties
